## Running in local environment

Ensure you have Node.js (11.4+) installed on your machine. Run `npm start` to create your local environment.

## Deployment

Run `npm run build`. This will build the page and the complete files will be created in the build directory.
Following that, you can run `npm run serve` to serve the built page on your local network.

To deploy to a custom domain network, follow your hosting provider's instructions. In `superhosting.bg`'s case, simply add the files to the subdomain or the main domain folder on your FTP server.
